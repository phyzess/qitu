# Package Boundaries

Status: draft  
Date: 2026-06-27

## 1. Boundary Rule

Core packages must be business-neutral. App-owned feature code may depend on core packages, but core packages must not depend on app-owned feature code.

```text
packages/* -> no business meaning
apps/* -> deployable entrypoints and app-local features
examples/* -> non-production examples that prove boundaries
templates/* -> copyable starting points
```

`qitu` does not require a top-level `domains/*` folder. Concrete apps may organize business code by feature, workflow, bounded context, or vertical slice.

`apps/worker/src/*` may contain app-local modules that adapt reusable package interfaces to Cloudflare bindings and route wiring. Current examples include auth route composition, the app role policy, source-file intake, the import adapter registry, import job runner, import review routes, audit D1 store, email delivery store, inbound email routing, HTTP route helpers, and runtime config helpers. These modules are intentionally app-owned: they may know D1/R2/Queue/Email bindings and starter tables, but they must not move business meaning into `packages/*`.

Inbound email routing is app-owned Worker wiring. `packages/email` owns generic message, receipt,
and attachment schemas; `apps/worker/src/inbound-email.ts` adapts Cloudflare Email Routing to raw
R2 storage, D1 metadata, and source-file import handoff.

4. Locale persistence policy.
5. React providers or UI controls.

### 2.8 Planned `security` Capability

Would own:

1. Security events.
2. Login failures.
3. Permission denial events.
4. Suspicious access patterns.

Does not own:

1. Business risk scoring.

### 2.9 Planned `alerts` Capability

For now, alerts stay in app-owned code or audit-driven operational views. Split a package only when alert lifecycle behavior becomes reusable.

Would own:

1. Alert creation.
2. Acknowledge/resolve.
3. Notification hooks.
4. Admin alert surfaces.

Does not own:

1. Business-specific escalation policy.

### 2.10 `packages/email`

Owns:

1. Transactional email sending.
2. Invitation email.
3. Password reset email.
4. Inbound email receipt and attachment schemas.
5. Provider-neutral email metadata contracts.

Does not own:

1. Business-specific attachment parsing.
2. Cloudflare Email Routing configuration.
3. Raw inbound R2 object key policy.
4. Source-file import handoff.

### 2.11 `packages/ai-advisory`

Owns:

1. AI provider abstraction.
2. Advisory artifact storage.
3. Prompt/result redaction.
4. Human-confirmation enforcement.
5. AI usage audit hooks.

Does not own:

1. Business calculations.
2. Business truth.

### 2.12 `packages/ui`

Owns:

1. App shell.
2. Topbar primary navigation and secondary route tabs.
3. Common panels.
4. Forms.
5. Tables.
6. Review workflow components.
7. Timeline components.

Does not own:

1. Business-specific pages.
2. Business terminology.
3. The downstream-owned `/workspace` home content.

### 2.13 `packages/design-system`

Owns:

1. Tokens.
2. Typography.
3. Color.
4. Motion.
5. Spacing.
6. Theme primitives.

Does not own:

1. Business information architecture.

### 2.14 `packages/charts`

Owns:

1. Chart primitives.
2. Chart themes.
3. Tooltip and legend behavior.
4. Internal visx usage.

Does not own:

1. Business chart meaning.
2. Business metric calculation.

## 3. Feature Adapter Contract

Business-owned import features may expose:

```ts
type ImportFeatureModule = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  routes?: unknown[];
  navigation?: unknown[];
  permissions?: unknown[];
  importAdapters?: ImportFeatureAdapter<unknown, unknown, unknown>[];
};
```

An import adapter should expose a narrow interface:

```ts
type ImportFeatureAdapter<TParsed, TStaged, TCommitted> = {
  id: string;
  canHandle(source: { filename: string; contentType: string }): boolean;
  parse(source: ReadableStream<Uint8Array>): Promise<TParsed[]>;
  stage(parsed: TParsed[]): Promise<TStaged[]>;
  validate(staged: TStaged): ReviewIssue[];
  commitApproved(input: {
    records: TStaged[];
    context: CommitApprovedContext;
  }): Promise<TCommitted[]>;
};
```

`CommitApprovedContext` is provided by the app layer after human confirmation. It carries confirmer identity, import job identity, approved staged record keys, and an idempotency key.

## 4. Anti-Leakage Checks

Before committing code to `packages/*`, ask:

1. Does this package mention a specific business?
2. Does it know a business-owned table name?
3. Does it know a business metric?
4. Does it decide business truth?
5. Would this package be reusable in a different internal tool?

If the answer is no for reuse, move it to app-owned feature code or an example.
