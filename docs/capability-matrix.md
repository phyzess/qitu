## Verification Targets

Near-term verification should be added in this order:

1. Static smoke checks for template invariants.
2. Worker handler integration with local D1/R2/Queue fakes.
3. Package type checks with TypeScript 7 RC.
4. Worker runtime tests covering Cloudflare Email Service, Queues, D1, and R2 binding behavior beyond the current minimal runtime smoke.
5. Broader adapter edge-case tests only when new real adapters add parser-specific risk.

## Production Readiness Gate

A capability becomes production-ready only when these are true:

1. It has tests that exercise success and failure paths.
2. It writes audit events for sensitive actions.
3. It has rate limits or abuse controls where relevant.
4. It has an operational recovery path.
5. It does not depend on AI output without human confirmation.
6. It has documented Cloudflare bindings and secrets.
